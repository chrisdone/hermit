This directory contains various optimization plugins implemented 
with the HERMIT Plugin DSL.

Note about submodules
=====================

Some of these directories are git submodule references.
When you first clone the HERMIT repository, you need to:

git submodule init
git submodule update

to pull down the contents of the submodules.

Whenever you pull new changes that include new submodule hashes,
you must:

git submodule update

NB: only do this after any changes you've made to submodules are pushed!

If you alter the contents of one of the submodules, commit the changes
and PUSH them to the submodule's public repository. Then, commit and push the
changed hash to the main HERMIT repository. i.e.

cd syb
... make some changes ...
git commit -a
git push
cd ..
(we are back in optimizations/, which is in the main HERMIT repository)
git commit -a
(commiting the changed submodule hash reference)
git push
